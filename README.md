I have found the normal 'research method' of discovering new materials tedious, time consuming and heavily reliant on expert opinion and assumptions.  I'm curious to know if historical calculated and empirical data holds any insights for the discovery of new materials.  I want to know what hidden insights may lie in crystallographic, thermodynamic and experimental data.
